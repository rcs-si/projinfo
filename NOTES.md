## working notes (from lindsay)

### current status:

    using pandas to filter through the csv files:
    using argparse to take inputs
    currently parsing copied versions of the csv files, so they wont update

    turning script into executable
    fix prefixes, come up w better names?

### questions:

- what exactly is in each csv:
- how can i tell if someone is a admin contact (no in the PI csv?)
- not sure how to turn this into an accessible tool

### discussion:
