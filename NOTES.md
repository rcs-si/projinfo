## working notes (from lindsay)

### current status:

using pandas to filter through the csv files:
using argparse to take inputs
currently parsing copied versions of the csv files, so they wont update
i am able to pip install . the package, but im getting this error:
    WARNING: The script function is installed in '/usr4/ugrad/tinglliu/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
    Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
not sure how to fix this, and i think part of the issue is because i am working on scc?

### questions:

what exactly is in each csv:
how can i tell if someone is a admin contact (no in the PI csv?)
not sure how to turn this into an accessible tool
